TODO:
 - wire up insert to instrument, make a test for that
 - any time we get an error do an EventErr
 - add a perf test for query sql gen
 - add a perf test for query sql with record mapping

 - Ideas:
   - selectBuilder.Query() *sql.Rows, err		// We might want to provide native sql.Rows support? Q: how does that impact metrics
   - selectBuilder.Count() -- ignores Columns, Limit, Offset, Order and calculates COUNT(*) -- but: having could reference cols?
     - i know rails/AR does some non-trivial stuff when you have joins. Things sometimes end up with DISTINCT in them.
